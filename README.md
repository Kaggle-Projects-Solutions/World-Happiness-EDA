### Introduction
The aim of this project was to demonstrate different visualisation techniques by using plotly library and analyse World hapiness datasets (2015-2019).

Before I started exporing and visualising the data, I realised that I was facing a setback - naming conventions of datasets columns are a mismatch. I have sorted this issue out in Data Manipulation section. Of course, I could use different approach to tackle this problem. 

At some point I created additional columns for continent and region by using pycountry_convert library.

I tried to use dynamic graphs and charts in EDA section where possible. It's cool to have fancy visuals, but it's even cooler to be able to provide insight... ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰

### Targets
 1. Combine all available datasets together by using pandas concat function.
 2. Data cleaning and manipulations
 3. Data enrichment - add country and region flags/columns by using pycountry_convert library and custom mapping.
 4. Use plotly to create interactive visuals.
 5. Provide insight based on data and data visualisations.
